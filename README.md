# CUDA Optimization & Parallel Algorithms 

## 📖 Introduction
This repository documents my journey in learning CUDA programming and parallel computing architecture. It contains implementations of fundamental and advanced algorithms, optimized from naive CPU implementations to highly tuned GPU kernels.

The goal of this project is not just to write code that runs on a GPU, but to have a deep practical understanding of the GPU memory hierarchy, warp divergence, occupancy, and instruction-level parallelism.

## Minimal prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with C/C++ or Python.
- A system with an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit installed (links and quick setup provided in the repo).
