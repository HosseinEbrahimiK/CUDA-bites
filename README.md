I created CUDA-bites because I couldn’t find concise, practical resources that teach CUDA the way I learn. It’s a compact, hands-on collection of bite-sized lessons and runnable examples that will take you from zero to a productive GPU developer in one week. Each unit focuses on a single practical concept (kernels, memory, concurrency, profiling, libraries) and includes clear explanations, short exercises, and a small capstone task so you can put the ideas into practice immediately.

## Minimal prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with C/C++ or Python.
- A system with an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit installed (links and quick setup provided in the repo).

## 7-Day roadmap
